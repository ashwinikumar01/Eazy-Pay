## ❓ Problem Statement
> The era is of Digital Transformation and in this era, why should money exchange be not digital too? Hence we came up with Eazy-Pay, an easy way for all transactions. Now easily send money from anywhere, anytime. Also, send money offline too. On offline money transfer, the person receiving the money receives a receipt using the Nearby API and once the devices connect to the Internet, they automatically connect to the server and complete the transaction thus providing a non blocking transaction experience.
